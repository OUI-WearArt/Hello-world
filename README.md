OUI WearArt was created by Ray & Henri Broady. Henri took Ray's watercolors and prep'd them to be put clothing, mugs, pillows plus more... For you the consumer to wear, drink from or lay your head on. What Henri needs from you now is to look at Ray's watercolors and pick what Henri should use next on another product.
